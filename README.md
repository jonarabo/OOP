# OOP
My program is one that consists of taking user input for the profits of any certain month and outputting the statistics of the owner and chefs. Additionally, I call for the user to input the tips for waiter 1, output their statistics and do the same for waiter 2 and waiter 3. I created this program through the use of polymorphism and inheritance. Employee.h serves as the parent class while Owner.h, Chef.h, and Waiter.h are child classes that inherit the common data members that all classes share. In my driver.cpp, I was able to create an array that serves as a database for each of the employees.
